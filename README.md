Server Side - J2EE with Hibernate framework, Oracle WebLogic 12 Server ,OpenCV for video processing, MySQL DB.

Developement Environment - 
Client Side - Android SDK in Eclipse.
Server Side - Oracle Middleware for J2EE development using eclipse on Linux platform (Ubuntu)
              OpenCV on linux platform (Ubuntu)
              MySQL DB on linux.
